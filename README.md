# Balancing-ball-on-a-plate
This is the result of my internship at Technical University of Eindhoven (Tu/e). It is working but I'm quite sure that it can be done better with higher precision for designing the controller, processing the images from the webcam. I would be delightful if you use this and improve it and then mention me your result.
